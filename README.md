# Project Issue: Encoding-128b-130b-to-5b-6b

## Introduction to Project:
128b/130b encoding is converted to 5b/6b by mapping 5-bit segments to 6-bit codes for DC balance and signal reliability. Error detection is achieved using CRC, which generates a checksum appended to the data. The receiver verifies this checksum to detect transmission errors, ensuring data integrity.
